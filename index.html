            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Sudarshan R, an educator with a deep passion for Quantitative Aptitude, Competitive Mathematics, Logical Reasoning, and Data Interpretation. 
                As a faculty member for CAT, IPMAT, GMAT, GRE, and other MBA entrance exams, I specialize in developing and proofreading coaching modules to help students excel in these competitive exams. 
                Additionally, I tutor Science and Mathematics for students in classes 8-12, with a strong focus on preparing for JEE Mains, NEET, and KCET.

With an academic background from the prestigious <b>Indian Institute of Science,</b> Bengaluru,
                I hold both MS and BS(Research) degrees, specializing in <b> Sustainability, Life Cycle Assessment, and Environmental Impact. </b> 
                My research expertise continues to inspire my work, as I aim to contribute to a more sustainable world.

Beyond education, I’m an author of spiritual and self-help books, and I share my insights through blogging and YouTube videos, particularly on the ancient language of Sanskrit. I am passionate about giving back to the community, which is why I run free educational campaigns and workshops, empowering others to grow and learn.
